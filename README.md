# Chartbeat Most Popular

## Introduction
This module is designed to be used with Chartbeat. If you do not have a Chartbeat account, it will not work.

## Requirements
You need to get your Chartbeat API key at https://chartbeat.com/apikeys/
The key MUST have toppages access in order to work. This is usually the default API key that comes with a Chartbeat 
account so you can use that.

## Recommended modules
Chartbeat -- https://www.drupal.org/project/chartbeat
It is recommended but not required. Be aware that if you use this module without using Chartbeat, you will need to 
appropriately limit the usage of Chartbeat Javascript to ONLY your publicly accessible nodes. This also means that you
should not use Chartbeat Javascript on taxonomy term pages as this module only works with nodes.

## Installation
Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
for further information.

## Configuration
After you enable this module, please go to admin/config/services/chartbeat_mostpopular to configure it.

You will see multiple fields there that you will have to fill in.
